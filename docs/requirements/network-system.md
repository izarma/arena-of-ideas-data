# Network System Requirements Document

## Overview
The Network System manages all client-server communication through SpacetimeDB, handling data synchronization, connection management, authentication, and real-time updates. It provides the foundation for multiplayer functionality and persistent game state across sessions.

## Core Responsibilities
- Establish and maintain connection to SpacetimeDB server
- Handle player authentication and identity management
- Synchronize game data between client and server in real-time
- Manage subscription patterns for efficient data loading
- Process server events and update local game state
- Handle network failures and connection recovery
- Provide offline mode capabilities where applicable
- Manage data migration and schema updates

## Dependencies
### Input Dependencies
- Player authentication credentials from login system
- Game state changes requiring server synchronization
- Node modifications that need persistence
- Match and battle data for multiplayer coordination
- Client settings and preferences for synchronization

### Output Dependencies
- All game systems depend on synchronized data from server
- Game state management uses connection status for state transitions
- UI system displays connection status and network errors
- Node system receives real-time updates from server
- Match system coordinates multiplayer game sessions

## Data Model
### Primary Node Types
- All node types are synchronized through the network system
- Player identity and authentication data
- Match and battle synchronization across clients
- Real-time updates for multiplayer coordination

### State Management
- Connection status and health monitoring
- Authentication state and session management
- Subscription management for data tables
- Local cache of server data with dirty tracking
- Network operation queue for offline support
- Migration state for schema updates

## User Interactions
### UI Components
- Connection status indicators in top bar
- Network error notifications and recovery options
- Login and authentication interfaces
- Offline mode notifications and limitations
- Data synchronization progress indicators

### Input Handling
- No direct user input (operates transparently)
- Responds to authentication actions from login system
- Handles user-initiated reconnection attempts

## Game Flow Integration
### Game States
- Connect: Initial server connection establishment
- Login: Authentication and player data loading
- ServerSync: Data synchronization operations
- MigrationDownload/Upload: Schema and data migration
- All active states: Real-time data synchronization

### Event Handling
- Connection establishment and loss events
- Authentication success and failure events
- Data synchronization completion events
- Server event processing and local state updates
- Network error recovery and retry logic

## Technical Architecture
### Plugin Structure
- StdbPlugin in src/plugins/stdb.rs
- ConnectPlugin in src/plugins/connect.rs
- Generated bindings in src/stdb/ directory
- Integration with spacetimedb-sdk for communication

### Key Components
- Connection management and health monitoring
- Authentication and identity handling
- Subscription management for data tables
- Event processing and local state updates
- Offline queue for network operations
- Migration utilities for schema updates

## Business Logic
### Rules and Constraints
- All persistent game data must be synchronized with server
- Authentication required before accessing multiplayer features
- Data consistency maintained across client-server boundary
- Optimistic updates with server reconciliation
- Network operations must be idempotent for retry safety
- Graceful degradation during network issues

### Algorithms
- Exponential backoff for connection retry logic
- Delta compression for efficient data transfer
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- Priority queuing for network operations
- Cache invalidation and consistency management
- Heartbeat monitoring for connection health

## Network Integration
### SpacetimeDB Tables
- All game tables defined in server schema
- Player and authentication tables
- Match and battle coordination tables
- Content and configuration tables
- Analytics and telemetry tables

### Client-Server Synchronization
- Real-time subscriptions for active game data
- Batch operations for bulk data transfer
- Incremental updates for modified records
- Conflict resolution with server authority
- Optimistic local updates with rollback capability

## Configuration
### Settings
- Server connection endpoints and credentials
- Subscription patterns and data filtering
- Network timeout and retry parameters
- Offline mode behavior and limitations
- Debug logging and network monitoring

### Content Data
- Server schema definitions and migrations
- Authentication configuration and security settings
- Data synchronization rules and priorities
- Network optimization parameters

## Testing Considerations
### Unit Test Areas
- Connection establishment and recovery logic
- Authentication flow and error handling
- Data synchronization accuracy and consistency
- Offline queue management and replay
- Migration and schema update procedures

### Integration Points
- Game state coordination with network status
- UI responsiveness during network operations
- Data consistency across all game systems
- Performance under various network conditions
- Security and authentication validation

## Future Considerations
### Planned Features
- Peer-to-peer networking for direct player communication
- Advanced caching strategies for improved performance
- Real-time spectator mode with streaming support
- Enhanced offline capabilities with local data storage
- Network analytics and performance monitoring

### Extensibility Points
- Plugin-based network protocol extensions
- Custom authentication provider integration
- External data source synchronization
- Third-party service integration (analytics, telemetry)
- Mod support for network feature extensions

## Implementation Notes
### Performance Requirements
- Sub-100ms latency for real-time game operations
- Efficient bandwidth usage for mobile networks
- Minimal memory overhead for network buffers
- Fast reconnection and state recovery
- Scalable connection handling for large player counts

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network disconnections
- Clear error messages for connection issues
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- User notification of network status changes
- Recovery strategies for corrupted network state
