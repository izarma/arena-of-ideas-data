# Game State Management Requirements Document

## Overview
The Game State Management system controls the overall flow and lifecycle of the game application, managing transitions between different game modes, screens, and operational states. It serves as the central coordinator for the application's state machine.

## Core Responsibilities
- Manage transitions between different game states (Title, Login, Shop, Battle, etc.)
- Coordinate plugin initialization and cleanup during state changes
- Handle application mode selection based on command-line arguments
- Provide a centralized state query interface for other systems
- Ensure proper state transition validation and error handling

## Dependencies
### Input Dependencies
- Command-line arguments via Args struct
- User interactions from UI systems
- Network connection status from ConnectPlugin
- Authentication status from LoginPlugin
- Match completion events from MatchPlugin

### Output Dependencies
- All game plugins depend on current state for their execution schedules
- UI systems query current state for display logic
- Loading systems use state for asset management
- Audio system responds to state changes for music/sound transitions

## Data Model
### Primary Node Types
- No direct node dependencies (operates at application level)

### State Management
- GameState enum with variants: Title, Login, Register, Connect, Loading, Loaded, Shop, Battle, Editor, TestScenariosRun, ServerSync, MigrationDownload, MigrationUpload, MatchOver, Error
- RunMode enum for application startup modes
- Static ARGS storage for command-line parameters
- Target state tracking for deferred transitions

## User Interactions
### UI Components
- No direct UI components (state changes triggered by other systems)
- State-dependent UI rendering throughout the application

### Input Handling
- Command-line argument parsing for initial state selection
- Indirect input through other systems triggering state changes

## Game Flow Integration
### Game States
- Title: Main menu and initial user interface
- Login: User authentication flow
- Register: New user registration
- Connect: Server connection establishment
- Loading: Asset and data loading phase
- Loaded: Post-loading initialization
- Shop: Match preparation and unit purchasing
- Battle: Combat simulation and viewing
- Editor: Battle scenario editing mode
- TestScenariosRun: Automated testing mode
- ServerSync: Data synchronization with server
- MigrationDownload/Upload: Database migration operations
- MatchOver: End-of-match summary and progression
- Error: Error state with recovery options

### Event Handling
- OnEnter events for state initialization
- OnExit events for state cleanup
- State transition validation
- Error state fallback mechanisms

## Technical Architecture
### Plugin Structure
- GameStatePlugin in src/plugins/game_state.rs (inferred)
- Integration in main.rs with .init_state::<GameState>()
- State-dependent system scheduling throughout plugins

### Key Components
- GameState enum implementing States trait
- RunMode enum for startup configuration
- Static Args storage with OnceCell
- Target state management for deferred transitions

## Business Logic
### Rules and Constraints
- Only one state active at a time
- State transitions must be valid (no arbitrary jumps)
- Error state accessible from any other state
- Loading state required before Loaded state
- Authentication required before accessing game features

### Algorithms
- State machine validation
- Transition queue management
- Error recovery logic
- Mode-dependent initial state selection

## Network Integration
### SpacetimeDB Tables
- No direct table dependencies (delegates to other systems)

### Client-Server Synchronization
- State changes may trigger network operations
- Connection status affects available states
- Offline mode restrictions on certain states

## Configuration
### Settings
- Command-line mode selection
- Development vs production behavior
- Debug state visibility

### Content Data
- No direct content dependencies

## Testing Considerations
### Unit Test Areas
- State transition validation
- Command-line argument parsing
- Error state recovery
- Mode selection logic

### Integration Points
- Plugin coordination during state changes
- Asset loading synchronization
- Network dependency management
- UI state consistency

## Future Considerations
### Planned Features
- Save/load state persistence
- State history tracking for debugging
- More granular sub-states within major states
- State-based feature flagging

### Extensibility Points
- Plugin-defined custom states
- State transition hooks for mods
- External state triggers via API

## Implementation Notes
### Performance Requirements
- Instant state transitions (no loading delays)
- Minimal memory overhead for state tracking
- Efficient state query operations

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to Error state
- State transition failure recovery
- User notification of state-related errors
- Debug logging for state changes
