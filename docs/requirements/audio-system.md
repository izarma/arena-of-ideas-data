# Audio System Requirements Document

## Overview
The Audio System manages all sound effects, music, and audio feedback throughout Arena of Ideas. It provides dynamic audio response to game events, manages audio assets, handles user audio preferences, and creates an immersive audio experience that enhances gameplay.

## Core Responsibilities
- Play background music appropriate to current game state
- Trigger sound effects for user interactions and game events
- Manage audio asset loading and memory usage
- Handle user audio preferences and volume controls
- Provide spatial audio for battle scenes and environmental effects
- Manage audio transitions between different game states
- Support audio accessibility features
- Handle audio streaming and compression for optimal performance

## Dependencies
### Input Dependencies
- Game state changes from GameStatePlugin for music transitions
- Battle events from BattlePlugin for combat sound effects
- UI interactions from UiPlugin for interface feedback
- Match events from MatchPlugin for game progression audio
- User settings from ClientSettingsPlugin for audio preferences
- Network events for connection audio feedback

### Output Dependencies
- No direct dependencies (audio is output-only system)
- Enhances user experience across all game systems
- Provides feedback for user actions and game state changes

## Data Model
### Primary Node Types
- No direct node dependencies (operates on events and state)
- May reference content nodes for audio asset associations

### State Management
- AudioAssets resource containing loaded sound and music files
- Current music track and playback state
- Active sound effect instances and their properties
- Audio settings and user preferences
- Spatial audio source positions for 3D effects
- Audio event queue for scheduled playback

## User Interactions
### UI Components
- Volume sliders for master, music, and sound effects
- Audio quality and format selection options
- Mute toggles for different audio categories
- Audio accessibility options (visual indicators for sound)
- Audio device selection and configuration

### Input Handling
- No direct input handling (responds to game events)
- Settings changes affect audio behavior immediately
- Debug controls for audio testing and troubleshooting

## Game Flow Integration
### Game States
- Loading: Audio asset loading and initialization
- Loaded: Audio system initialization and setup
- Title: Main menu music and ambient sounds
- Login/Register: UI feedback sounds
- Shop: Shop ambience and transaction sounds
- Battle: Combat music and dynamic sound effects
- Editor: Creative mode audio with reduced intensity
- All states: Consistent UI sound feedback

### Event Handling
- Game state transition triggers music changes
- Battle events trigger combat sound effects
- UI interactions generate immediate audio feedback
- Network events provide connection status audio cues
- Match progression events trigger celebration or defeat sounds

## Technical Architecture
### Plugin Structure
- AudioPlugin in src/plugins/audio.rs
- Systems scheduled in Update for continuous audio management
- OnEnter system for state-specific audio initialization
- Integration with bevy_audio for playback capabilities

### Key Components
- AudioAssets resource for asset management
- Music state tracking and crossfading
- Sound effect pooling and management
- Spatial audio calculation and positioning
- Audio event queue and scheduling system
- Volume and mixing controls

## Business Logic
### Rules and Constraints
- Audio must never block gameplay or cause performance issues
- All sounds should be appropriate for the game's theme and rating
- Audio feedback should be immediate and responsive
- Volume levels must be balanced and not cause ear damage
- Audio assets should be optimized for memory and loading time
- Accessibility considerations for hearing-impaired players

### Algorithms
- Audio event priority and mixing calculations
- Spatial audio distance and direction calculations
- Music crossfading and transition algorithms
- Dynamic range compression for consistent volume
- Audio streaming and buffering for large files
- Echo and reverb effects for environmental audio

## Network Integration
### SpacetimeDB Tables
- No direct table access (audio is client-side only)
- May sync audio preferences across devices

### Client-Server Synchronization
- Audio preferences synchronized across player sessions
- No real-time audio synchronization required
- Audio events triggered by network state changes

## Configuration
### Settings
- Master volume control (0-100%)
- Music volume control (0-100%)
- Sound effects volume control (0-100%)
- Audio quality settings (low, medium, high)
- Audio device selection and configuration
- Spatial audio enable/disable toggle
- Audio accessibility options

### Content Data
- Audio asset definitions and loading configurations
- Music playlists for different game states
- Sound effect libraries and categorization
- Audio compression and format specifications
- Spatial audio environment definitions

## Testing Considerations
### Unit Test Areas
- Audio asset loading and memory management
- Volume control and mixing calculations
- Audio event scheduling and timing
- Spatial audio position calculations
- Settings persistence and application
- Performance under high audio load

### Integration Points
- Game state transitions and music changes
- Battle system integration for combat audio
- UI system integration for feedback sounds
- Settings system for preference management
- Performance impact on overall game systems

## Future Considerations
### Planned Features
- Dynamic music composition based on game state
- Voice acting and dialogue system integration
- Advanced spatial audio with room acoustics
- Audio modding support for custom sounds
- Real-time voice chat integration
- Audio visualization for accessibility

### Extensibility Points
- Plugin-based audio effect system
- Custom music and sound replacement
- Audio scripting for complex sequences
- Third-party audio library integration
- Streaming audio from external sources

## Implementation Notes
### Performance Requirements
- Audio latency under 50ms for responsive feedback
- Efficient memory usage for audio assets
- Minimal CPU overhead for audio processing
- Smooth audio transitions without clicks or pops
- Support for various audio formats and qualities

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when audio devices are unavailable
- Silent operation when audio assets fail to load
- User notification for audio-related errors
- Recovery from audio system failures
- Validation of audio file formats and integrity
