# UI System Requirements Document

## Overview
The UI System provides the complete user interface framework for Arena of Ideas, built on top of egui and bevy_egui. It manages all visual presentation, user interactions, layout management, and visual styling across all game states and features.

## Core Responsibilities
- Provide consistent visual styling and theming throughout the game
- Manage layout and rendering of all UI panels and windows
- Handle user input routing to appropriate game systems
- Coordinate state-dependent UI visibility and behavior
- Manage UI animations and visual transitions
- Provide reusable UI components and widgets
- Handle responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Manage modal dialogs and confirmation systems

## Dependencies
### Input Dependencies
- Game state from GameStatePlugin for conditional rendering
- Node data from NodeStatePlugin for content display
- Match data from MatchPlugin for game interface
- Battle data from BattlePlugin for combat visualization
- Player data for personalization and settings
- Network status for connection indicators
- Audio state for sound controls

### Output Dependencies
- All game systems receive user input events through UI
- Game state management receives navigation commands
- Match system receives shop and team management interactions
- Battle system receives combat control inputs
- Settings systems receive configuration changes
- Network systems receive connection requests

## Data Model
### Primary Node Types
- All node types for data visualization and editing
- Player nodes for profile and settings display
- Match nodes for game interface
- Team and unit nodes for shop and battle interfaces

### State Management
- UI state resources for panel visibility and layout
- Theme and styling configuration
- Animation state for transitions and effects
- Modal dialog stack management
- Input focus and keyboard navigation state
- Window and panel positioning data

## User Interactions
### UI Components
- Top bar with navigation and status indicators
- Game-specific panels (shop, battle, team editor)
- Node explorer for data inspection and debugging
- Settings and configuration dialogs
- Modal confirmations and error dialogs
- Status notifications and alerts
- Responsive layout containers and panels

### Input Handling
- Mouse interactions (clicks, drags, hover)
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Touch gestures for mobile platforms
- Gamepad support for console-style navigation
- Context menus and right-click actions
- Drag-and-drop for unit and item management

## Game Flow Integration
### Game States
- Title: Main menu and initial navigation
- Login/Register: Authentication interfaces
- Shop: Team building and unit management interface
- Battle: Combat visualization and controls
- Editor: Content creation and testing tools
- All states: Consistent navigation and status display

### Event Handling
- State transition UI updates
- Real-time data synchronization with visual updates
- Animation completion events
- User input validation and feedback
- Modal dialog lifecycle management
- Notification display and dismissal

## Technical Architecture
### Plugin Structure
- UiPlugin in src/plugins/ui.rs
- Individual UI modules in src/ui/ directory
- Integration with bevy_egui for rendering
- Custom widget implementations for game-specific needs
- State-dependent system scheduling

### Key Components
- Custom widgets and UI components
- Layout management systems
- Theme and styling resources
- Animation and transition systems
- Input handling and routing
- Modal dialog management
- Notification system integration

## Business Logic
### Rules and Constraints
- Consistent visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Accessible design following UI/UX best practices
- Performance optimization for 60 FPS rendering
- Responsive design for various screen resolutions
- Colorblind-friendly color schemes
- Clear visual feedback for all user actions

### Algorithms
- Layout calculation and optimization
- Animation easing and interpolation
- Input event priority and routing
- Dynamic content sizing and positioning
- Efficient rendering with minimal redraws
- Focus management and keyboard navigation

## Network Integration
### SpacetimeDB Tables
- No direct table access (delegates to other systems)
- Real-time updates trigger UI refresh

### Client-Server Synchronization
- Visual indicators for network status
- Optimistic updates with rollback visual feedback
- Loading states during network operations
- Error display for network failures
- Offline mode UI adaptations

## Configuration
### Settings
- Theme selection and customization
- Font size and accessibility options
- Animation speed and effects toggles
- Layout preferences and panel arrangements
- Color scheme and contrast adjustments
- Input sensitivity and control customization

### Content Data
- UI asset files and images
- Font definitions and text resources
- Color palette and theme definitions
- Layout templates and configurations
- Animation definitions and timing curves

## Testing Considerations
### Unit Test Areas
- Widget rendering and layout calculation
- Input event handling and routing
- Animation timing and state management
- Theme application and color consistency
- Responsive layout behavior
- Accessibility compliance

### Integration Points
- Game state synchronization accuracy
- Data display consistency with backend
- Performance under high UI complexity
- Cross-platform rendering consistency
- Input handling across different devices

## Future Considerations
### Planned Features
- Advanced animation system with timeline editing
- Plugin-based UI customization for mods
- Multi-language localization support
- Advanced accessibility features
- VR/AR interface adaptations
- Streaming and spectator mode interfaces

### Extensibility Points
- Custom widget creation framework
- Theme plugin system for user customization
- Layout template system for different game modes
- External UI integration for streaming overlays
- Mod support for UI modifications

## Implementation Notes
### Performance Requirements
- Maintain 60 FPS during all UI interactions
- Efficient memory usage for UI resources
- Minimal CPU overhead for idle UI
- Fast startup and state transition times
- Smooth animations without frame drops

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for missing UI assets
- Error display with user-friendly messages
- Recovery from UI state corruption
- Input validation with clear feedback
- Fallback layouts for rendering failures
