# Plugin System Requirements Document

## Overview
The Plugin System provides the architectural foundation for Arena of Ideas, organizing game functionality into modular, reusable components built on top of Bevy's plugin architecture. It manages plugin initialization, dependencies, lifecycle, and coordination between different game systems.

## Core Responsibilities
- Organize game functionality into cohesive, modular plugins
- Manage plugin initialization order and dependencies
- Coordinate system scheduling across different Bevy schedules
- Provide shared resources and interfaces between plugins
- Handle plugin lifecycle events and cleanup
- Support hot-reloading and dynamic plugin management for development
- Ensure proper plugin isolation and encapsulation
- Manage cross-plugin communication and event handling

## Dependencies
### Input Dependencies
- Bevy App instance for plugin registration
- Command-line arguments for configuration and mode selection
- Game state for conditional plugin activation
- Resource initialization data from various sources

### Output Dependencies
- All game systems are organized as plugins
- Game state management coordinates plugin activation
- Resource sharing enables cross-plugin communication
- Event systems facilitate plugin interaction

## Data Model
### Primary Node Types
- No direct node dependencies (architectural layer)
- Plugins may define their own node relationships

### State Management
- Plugin registration and activation state
- Cross-plugin resource sharing mechanisms
- System scheduling and execution order
- Plugin configuration and settings
- Hot-reload state for development features

## User Interactions
### UI Components
- No direct user interface (infrastructure layer)
- Individual plugins provide their own UI components
- Debug interfaces for plugin inspection and management

### Input Handling
- No direct input handling (delegated to individual plugins)
- Plugin coordination for input event routing
- Debug input for plugin management features

## Game Flow Integration
### Game States
- Plugins operate across all game states
- State-dependent plugin activation and deactivation
- Plugin systems scheduled based on current game state

### Event Handling
- Cross-plugin event communication patterns
- Plugin lifecycle events (initialization, cleanup)
- System coordination events between plugins

## Technical Architecture
### Plugin Structure
Primary Plugins in src/plugins/mod.rs:
- UiPlugin: User interface management and rendering
- LoginPlugin: Player authentication and session management
- GameStatePlugin: Application state machine coordination
- NodeStatePlugin: Game data structure management
- RepresentationPlugin: Visual representation and theming
- GameTimerPlugin: Time tracking and scheduling
- WindowPlugin: Window management and display settings
- MatchPlugin: Game session and match management
- PersistentDataPlugin: Data persistence and loading
- BattlePlugin: Combat system and battle execution
- NodeExplorerPlugin: Development and debugging tools
- BattleEditorPlugin: Battle scenario creation and testing
- OperationsPlugin: Asynchronous operation management
- ConnectPlugin: Network connection management
- ClientSettingsPlugin: User preferences and configuration
- TilePlugin: UI layout and tile management
- AudioPlugin: Sound and music management
- ConfirmationPlugin: Modal dialog and confirmation systems
- AdminPlugin: Administrative tools and features
- StdbPlugin: SpacetimeDB integration and networking
- NotificationsPlugin: User notification and alert system

### Key Components
- Plugin trait implementations for each major system
- Shared resource definitions for cross-plugin communication
- System scheduling coordination between plugins
- Event bus systems for plugin interaction
- Configuration management for plugin settings

## Business Logic
### Rules and Constraints
- Plugins must be self-contained with clear boundaries
- Dependencies between plugins should be explicit and minimal
- Each plugin should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Plugin initialization order must be deterministic
- Plugins should gracefully handle missing dependencies
- Hot-reloading must not break game state consistency

### Algorithms
- Dependency resolution for plugin initialization order
- Resource sharing and ownership management
- Event routing and priority handling
- System scheduling optimization across plugins
- Plugin lifecycle management and cleanup

## Network Integration
### SpacetimeDB Tables
- Individual plugins handle their own table interactions
- Plugin system provides shared networking utilities
- Connection management coordinated across plugins

### Client-Server Synchronization
- Plugins coordinate for consistent network state
- Shared networking resources and connection pooling
- Event synchronization across plugin boundaries

## Configuration
### Settings
- Plugin-specific configuration management
- Global plugin system settings and behavior
- Development mode features and debugging options
- Plugin activation and deactivation settings
- Resource allocation and performance tuning

### Content Data
- Plugin content loading and management
- Shared asset systems between plugins
- Content validation and dependency checking

## Testing Considerations
### Unit Test Areas
- Plugin initialization and dependency resolution
- Resource sharing and isolation between plugins
- System scheduling correctness and performance
- Plugin lifecycle management and cleanup
- Event handling and communication patterns

### Integration Points
- Cross-plugin data consistency and synchronization
- Performance impact of plugin architecture overhead
- Plugin interaction patterns and edge cases
- Resource contention and sharing mechanisms
- State management across plugin boundaries

## Future Considerations
### Planned Features
- Dynamic plugin loading and unloading at runtime
- Plugin marketplace and mod support infrastructure
- Advanced plugin dependency management with versioning
- Plugin performance profiling and optimization tools
- Automated plugin testing and validation frameworks

### Extensibility Points
- Third-party plugin development SDK
- Plugin API standardization for mod creators
- External plugin repository and distribution system
- Plugin security and sandboxing mechanisms
- Cross-platform plugin compatibility layers

## Implementation Notes
### Performance Requirements
- Minimal overhead from plugin architecture
- Efficient resource sharing between plugins
- Fast plugin initialization and startup times
- Optimized system scheduling across plugin boundaries
- Memory efficiency in plugin resource management

### Error Handling
- Graceful plugin failure isolation and recovery
- Clear error reporting for plugin initialization failures
- Fallback mechanisms for missing or failed plugins
- Debug information for plugin development and troubleshooting
- User-friendly error messages for plugin-related issues
