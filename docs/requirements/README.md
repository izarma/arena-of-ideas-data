# Arena of Ideas - Requirements Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive requirements documents for all major systems in Arena of Ideas. These documents serve as the definitive specification for understanding, implementing, and maintaining game features.

## Purpose

Requirements documents provide:
- Clear understanding of system responsibilities and boundaries
- Implementation guidance for developers
- Context for AI assistants working on the codebase
- Architecture decisions and design rationale
- Testing and validation criteria
- Future planning and extensibility considerations

## Document Structure

Each requirements document follows a standardized template (see `TEMPLATE.md`) covering:
- System overview and core responsibilities
- Dependencies and integration points
- Data models and technical architecture
- User interactions and business logic
- Network integration and configuration
- Testing considerations and future plans

## System Documentation

### Core Systems
- **[Game State Management](game-state-management.md)** - Application state machine and flow control
- **[Node System](node-system.md)** - Data architecture and hierarchical relationships
- **[Plugin System](plugin-system.md)** - Modular architecture and system coordination

### Gameplay Systems
- **[Battle System](battle-system.md)** - Combat simulation and visualization
- **[Match System](match-system.md)** - Game sessions, progression, and shop mechanics

### Infrastructure Systems
- **[UI System](ui-system.md)** - User interface framework and visual presentation
- **[Network System](network-system.md)** - Client-server communication and synchronization
- **[Audio System](audio-system.md)** - Sound effects, music, and audio feedback

## How to Use These Documents

### For Developers
1. Read the overview section to understand the system's purpose
2. Review dependencies to understand integration requirements
3. Study the technical architecture for implementation details
4. Use business logic section for rule implementation
5. Reference testing considerations for validation

### For AI Assistants
These documents provide essential context for:
- Understanding system boundaries and responsibilities
- Making informed implementation decisions
- Maintaining consistency with existing architecture
- Avoiding breaking changes to dependent systems
- Following established patterns and conventions

### For Project Planning
Use requirements documents to:
- Estimate development effort and complexity
- Identify system dependencies and critical paths
- Plan testing and validation strategies
- Understand technical debt and refactoring needs
- Design future features and extensions

## Document Maintenance

Requirements documents should be updated when:
- System architecture changes significantly
- New features are added that affect system responsibilities
- Dependencies between systems are modified
- Business rules or constraints change
- Performance requirements are updated

## Contributing

When creating or updating requirements documents:
1. Follow the standardized template structure
2. Keep language clear and implementation-agnostic where possible
3. Include specific technical details where necessary
4. Update related documents when dependencies change
5. Validate that implementation matches requirements
